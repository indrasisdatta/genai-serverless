Options for lambda with large deps (should be <50MB zipped and <250MB unzipped):
1. ECR Container images (up to 10GB) - package your Lambda as a Docker image and push it to ECR (Elastic Container Registry). --package-type Image 
(ECR costs after 500MB free tier) 

2. Store libs in S3 and download into /tmp (512MB - 10GB). But first request may be slow. 

Alternatives to Lambda - DockerHub + ECS on EC2 
1. Push your image to DockerHub and then configure ECS EC2 to pull from DockerHub. 

ECS on EC2 - advantages:
 - it gives service management (restart if crash)
 - scaling (run N containers across cluster)
 - integraton with ALB, CloudWatch logs etc 

EC2 directly - no auto-scaling, need to restart container manually if it crashes, no in built-in load balancer
