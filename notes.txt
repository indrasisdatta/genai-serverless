To store dependencies in Lambda layers, note zipped file size should be < 50MB and unzipped file size < 250MB.

Options for lambda with large deps:
    1. ECR Container images (up to 10GB) - package your Lambda as a Docker image and push it to ECR (Elastic Container Registry). --package-type Image 
    (ECR costs after 500MB free tier) 
    2. Store libs in S3 and download into /tmp (512MB - 10GB). But first request may be slow. 

Alternatives to Lambda - DockerHub + ECS on EC2 
Push your image to DockerHub and then configure ECS EC2 to pull from DockerHub. 

ECS on EC2 - advantages:
 - it gives service management (restart if crash)
 - scaling (run N containers across cluster)
 - integraton with ALB, CloudWatch logs etc 

EC2 directly - no auto-scaling, need to restart container manually if it crashes, no in built-in load balancer 


ECS - cluster, task definition, service 

EC2 instance has ECS agent running, which does docker pull
